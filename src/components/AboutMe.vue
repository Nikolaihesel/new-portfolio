                    Hello There! <br>
                    I'm Nikolai - a 25 year old MultiMediaDesign student based in Odense.
                    I'm currently at my third semester, and am now looking for an internship as a UI Developer /
                    Designer. <br>
                    Before starting my journey In the world of design, i was a sales advisor for a large shipping
                    company, and then later at a mid level aftermarket
                    company, handling clients in the heavy transport sector.
                    Now every thing I do, is based around design and development, and i'm really enjoying the creativity
                    surrounding both the development and design process. <br>
                    I'm really looking forward to be getting even better at everything.
                    Please continue reading and let me show of some of my skills! <i
